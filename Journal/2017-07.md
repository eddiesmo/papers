> In short, despite our progress on machine perception, we are still very far from human-level AI: our models can only perform local generalization, adapting to new situations that must stay very close from past data, while human cognition is capable of extreme generalization, quickly adapting to radically novel situations, or planning very for long-term future situations.


> Here's what you should remember: the only real success of deep learning so far has been the ability to map space X to space Y using a continuous geometric transform, given large amounts of human-annotated data. Doing this well is a game-changer for essentially every industry, but it is still a very long way from human-level AI.

1.  Image Segmentation by Iterative Inference from Conditional Score Estimation

    https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07450

    A net that performs slightly better than CRF for image segmentation fine-tuning/post-processing.

    Questions:
    1. Whatâ€™s the runtime, compared with CRF?
    2. Will the code/model be publicly available?

2.  Explored https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification

    `Real-time face detection and emotion/gender classification using fer2013/imdb datasets with a keras CNN model and openCV.`

    very simple example for KERAS use

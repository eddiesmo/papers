# Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift [2015]
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf

> Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact
that the distribution of each layerâ€™s inputs changes during
training, as the parameters of the previous layers change.
This slows down the training by requiring lower learning
rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it 
notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities.
We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate
shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs.
Our method draws its strength from making normalization
a part of the model architecture and performing the
normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization
allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer,
in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout.
Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model,
Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model
by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch normalized
networks, we improve upon the best published
result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy
of human raters.
